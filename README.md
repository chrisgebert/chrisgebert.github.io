Just a fun little single pager I whipped up to test out my new scroll events plugin
(github.com/ajlkn/jquery.scrollex). Clean, simple, fully responsive, and loaded with
all the usual pre-styled elements. Enjoy :)

Feedback, bug reports, and comments are not only welcome, but strongly encouraged :)

PS: Not sure how to get that contact form working? Give formspree.io a try (it's awesome).
